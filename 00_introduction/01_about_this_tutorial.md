# About this tutorial

Welcome – to «**Learn you a “Haskell” (for great good)**».

If you're reading this, – chances – are: you – want to learn “Haskell” … Well; you've come to the right place, – but let's talk (about this tutorial) a bit, first?

I decided to write this, – because I wanted to solidify my *own* knowledge (of “Haskell”), and because, I thought: I – could **help** people (new, to “Haskell”) to learn it, from *my* perspective! 

## Reasons for creation

There – are quite a *few* tutorials (on “Haskell”), – floating around the “Internet”… When I was starting out (in “Haskell”) – I didn't learn from just *one* resource; the way I learned – was through reading *different* tutorials (and articles), because each – explained (some thing) in an other way… 

By going – I was able put to together the pieces; and, it all – just came falling, into place… So, this – is an attempt at adding an *other* useful resource (for learning “Haskell”); so, you – will have a *bigger* chance, of finding one you like.

## Experience to have

This (tutorial) – is aimed at people, who *have* experience (in *imperative* programming languages: “C”, “C++”, “Java”, “Python” …), – but – haven't programmed in a *functional* language (“Haskell”, “ML”, “OCaml” …). 

Although (I bet that), even if you *don't* have any “significant” programming experience, – a smart person (such as your self) – *will* be able to follow along (and – learn “Haskell”)!

## IRC-channel

The channel **“#haskell”** (on the [“Free Node” Net-Work](https://freenode.net/)) – is a *great* place (to ask questions), if you're feeling “stuck”… 

People (there) – are *extremely* nice, patient, and – under-standing (to newbies).

## Author’s opinion

I – failed to learn “Haskell” (approximately – 2 times, before finally grasping it), because it all – just… seemed too *weird*, to me; and, – I – didn't *get* it. 

But *then* (once), – it – just “clicked”; and (after getting *over* that initial hurdle) – it was (pretty much) a *smooth* “sailing”… I guess: what I'm trying to say, – is: “Haskell” – is great… and (if you're interested in programming), you – *should* really learn it (even – if it seems weird, at first). 

## New paradigm

Learning “Haskell” – is much like learning to program, for the first time: it's fun! … It forces you – to think *differently* (which, brings us – to the next section)…
