# About this tutorial

Welcome, – to learn you a “Haskell”, for great good! … 💡

If you're reading this, – chances – are: you *want* to learn “Haskell” … Well; you've came to the *right place*, – but let's talk (about this **tutorial**) a *bit*, first? … ✋

I decided to write this – because I wanted to solidify *my own* knowledge (of “Haskell”), and – because I thought: I *could* **help** people (new, to “Haskell”) to learn it, from **my** perspective! 👨‍🎓

## Reasons for creation ☝

There – were quite a *few* tutorials (on “Haskell”, floating around the “Internet” 🌐). When I was starting out (in “Haskell”) – I didn't learn from just *one* resource; the way I learned – was through reading *different* tutorials (and articles), because each one explained something in *another* way! 🎭

By going – I was able put to together the pieces; and – it all just came falling, into place 🧩 … So, this – is an attempt – at adding *another* useful resource (for, learning “Haskell”); – so – you – will have a *bigger* chance, of finding one you like! ♥ ♠ ♣ ♦

## Experience to have 🎓

This tutorial – is aimed at people, who *have* experience in **imperative** programming languages (“C”, “C++”, “Java”, “Python”, …), – but – haven't programmed in a **functional** language (“Haskell”, “ML”, “OCaml”, …). ♥ ♠

Although (I bet that) even if you *don't* have any “significant” programming experience – a *smart* person (such, as yourself) *will* be able to follow along – and – **learn** “Haskell”! 💪

## IRC-channel ⚡

The channel “**#haskell**” (on the [“Free Node” Net-Work](https://freenode.net/)) – is a *great* place to ask questions, if you're feeling “stuck”. 👁‍🗨

People there – are *extremely* nice, patient, and understanding (to newbies). 🗨🧞‍♀️🧞‍♂️

## Author’s opinion 👾

I failed to learn “Haskell” approximately 2 times (before finally “grasping” it) – because it all just seemed *too weird* to me, and I didn't get it. 🖇

But *then* (once) – it just “clicked”; and (after getting over that initial “hurdle”) it was pretty much a *smooth* “sailing” 🛶 … I guess, what I'm trying to say – is: “Haskell” – is **great**, – and (if you're interested, in programming) you should *really* learn it (even – if it seems *weird*, at first). 👻

## New paradigm 👽

Learning “Haskell” – is much like learning to program for the *first* time: it's fun! 🎓 … It forces you to think **differently** (which – brings us to the *next* section). ✨
