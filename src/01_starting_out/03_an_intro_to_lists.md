# An intro to lists

Much like shopping lists in the real world, lists in Haskell are very useful.
It's the most used data structure and it can be used in a multitude of different
ways to model and solve a whole bunch of problems. Lists are SO awesome. In this
section we'll look at the basics of lists, strings (which are lists) and list
comprehensions. 

In Haskell, lists are a **homogenous** data structure. It stores several
elements of the same type. That means that we can have a list of integers or a
list of characters but we can't have a list that has a few integers and then a
few characters. And now, a list! 

> **Note**: We can use the `let` keyword to define a name right in GHCI. Doing
> `let a = 1` inside GHCI is the equivalent of writing `a = 1 in` a script and
> then loading it. 

```haskell
ghci> let lostNumbers = [4,8,15,16,23,42]  
ghci> lostNumbers  
[4,8,15,16,23,42]  
```

As you can see, lists are denoted by square brackets and the values in the lists
are separated by commas. If we tried a list like `[1,2,'a',3,'b','c',4]`,
Haskell would complain that characters (which are, by the way, denoted as a
character between single quotes) are not numbers. Speaking of characters,
strings are just lists of characters. `"hello"`is just syntactic sugar for
`['h','e','l','l','o']`. Because strings are lists, we can use list functions on
them, which is really handy. 

A common task is putting two lists together. This is done by using the `++`
operator. 

```haskell
ghci> [1,2,3,4] ++ [9,10,11,12]  
[1,2,3,4,9,10,11,12]  
ghci> "hello" ++ " " ++ "world"  
"hello world"  
ghci> ['w','o'] ++ ['o','t']  
"woot"
```

Watch out when repeatedly using the `++` operator on long strings. When you put
together two lists (even if you append a singleton list to a list, for
instance: `[1,2,3] ++ [4]`), internally, Haskell has to walk through the whole
list on the left side of `++`. That's not a problem when dealing with lists
that aren't too big. But putting something at the end of a list that's fifty
million entries long is going to take a while. However, putting something at
the beginning of a list using the `:` operator (also called the cons operator)
is instantaneous. 

```haskell
ghci> 'A':" SMALL CAT"  
"A SMALL CAT"  
ghci> 5:[1,2,3,4,5]  
[5,1,2,3,4,5]
```

Notice how `:` takes a number and a list of numbers or a character and a list
of characters, whereas `++` takes two lists. Even if you're adding an element
to the end of a list with `++`, you have to surround it with square brackets so
it becomes a list. 

`[1,2,3]` is actually just syntactic sugar for `1:2:3:[]`. `[]` is an empty list. If we prepend `3` to it, it becomes `[3]`. If we prepend `2` to that, it becomes `[2,3]`, and so on. 

> **Note**: `[]`, `[[]]` and `[[],[],[]]` are all different things. The first
> one is an empty list, the seconds one is a list that contains one empty list,
> the third one is a list that contains three empty lists.

If you want to get an element out of a list by index, use `!!`. The indices start at 0.

```haskell
ghci> "Steve Buscemi" !! 6  
'B'  
ghci> [9.4,33.2,96.2,11.2,23.25] !! 1  
33.2  
```

But if you try to get the sixth element from a list that only has four elements,
you'll get an error so be careful!

Lists can also contain lists. They can also contain lists that contain lists
that contain lists â€¦ 


```haskell
ghci> let b = [[1,2,3,4],[5,3,3,3],[1,2,2,3,4],[1,2,3]]  
ghci> b  
[[1,2,3,4],[5,3,3,3],[1,2,2,3,4],[1,2,3]]  
ghci> b ++ [[1,1,1,1]]  
[[1,2,3,4],[5,3,3,3],[1,2,2,3,4],[1,2,3],[1,1,1,1]]  
ghci> [6,6,6]:b  
[[6,6,6],[1,2,3,4],[5,3,3,3],[1,2,2,3,4],[1,2,3]]  
ghci> b !! 2  
[1,2,2,3,4]   
```

The lists within a list can be of different lengths but they can't be of
different types. Just like you can't have a list that has some characters and
some numbers, you can't have a list that has some lists of characters and some
lists of numbers.

Lists can be compared if the stuff they contain can be compared. When using `<`,
`<=`, `>` and `>=` to compare lists, they are compared in lexicographical order.
First the heads are compared. If they are equal then the second elements are
compared, etc.

```haskell
ghci> [3,2,1] > [2,1,0]  
True  
ghci> [3,2,1] > [2,10,100]  
True  
ghci> [3,4,2] > [3,4]  
True  
ghci> [3,4,2] > [2,4]  
True  
ghci> [3,4,2] == [3,4,2]  
True  
```

What else can you do with lists? Here are some basic functions that operate on
lists. 

**`head`** takes a list and returns its head. The head of a list is basically
its first element. 

```haskell
ghci> head [5,4,3,2,1]  
5   
```

**`tail`** takes a list and returns its tail. In other words, it chops off a
list's head.

```haskell
ghci> tail [5,4,3,2,1]  
[4,3,2,1]   
```

**`last`** takes a list and returns its last element.

```haskell
ghci> last [5,4,3,2,1]  
1   
```

**`init`** takes a list and returns everything except its last element.

```haskell
ghci> init [5,4,3,2,1]  
[5,4,3,2]   
```

If we think of a list as a monster, here's what's what.
