# About this tutorial

Welcome – to **«Learn you a “Haskell” (for great good)».** 

If you're reading this – chances are: you – want to learn “Haskell”… Well; you – 've come to the right place, – but let's talk (about this tutorial) a bit, first?

I decided to write this – because I wanted to solidify my *own* knowledge (of “Haskell”), and because I thought: I – could help people (new, to “Haskell”) to learn it, from my perspective… There – are quite a *few* tutorials (on “Haskell”), – floating around the “Internet”… 

When I was starting out (in “Haskell”) – I didn't learn from just *one* resource. The way I learned it – was by reading *several* different tutorials (and articles), because each – explained (something) in a different way (than – the other did)… By going through several resources – I was able put together the pieces; and, it all – just came falling, into place… So, this – is an attempt at adding *another* useful resource (for learning “Haskell”); so – you will have a *bigger* chance, of finding one you like…

This (tutorial) – is aimed at people, who *have* experience in **imperative** programming languages (“C”, “C++”, “Java”, “Python” …), – but – haven't programmed in a *functional* language, before (“Haskell”, “ML”, “OCaml” …). Although (I bet that), even if you *don't* have any “significant” programming experience, – a smart person (such – as yourself) – **will** be able to follow along (and – learn “Haskell”)!

The channel “#haskell” (on the “Free Node” net-work) – is a *great* place: to ask questions, if you're feeling “stuck”… People (there) – are *extremely* nice, patient, and – under-standing (to newbies).

I failed to learn “Haskell” – approximately 2 times (before finally grasping it), because it all just seemed too *weird* to me, and – I didn't get it. But then, once – it just “clicked”; and, after getting over that initial hurdle, – it was a pretty much smooth sailing… I guess, what I'm trying to say – is: “Haskell” – is great, and if you're interested in programming – you should *really* learn it (even – if it seems weird, at first). Learning “Haskell” – is much like learning to program for the first time: it's fun! It forces you – to think differently (which – brings us to the next section)…
