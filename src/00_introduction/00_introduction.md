# Introduction

Hey yo! This is **Learn You a Haskell**, the funkiest way to learn Haskell, which is the best functional programming language around. You may have heard of it. This guide is meant for people who have programmed already, but have yet to try functional programming.

The whole thing is completely free to read online, but it's also available [in print](https://nostarch.com/lyah.htm) and I encourage you to buy as many copies as you can afford!

To contact me, shoot me an email to: bonus at learnyouahaskell dot com! You can also find me idling on [#haskell](irc://irc.freenode.net/haskell) where I go by the name BONUS.
